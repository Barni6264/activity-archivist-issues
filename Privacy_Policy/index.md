# Privacy Policy for Activity Archivist
**Last updated:** 2025 September 08
- This policy explains what data Activity Archivist collects, how it is used, and what control you have over it.

---

## Data We Collect
- **Public Discord activity data**: your current game/status messages (e.g. "Playing ...").
- **Usage logs**: records of which commands were used and when (accessible only to the developer (Barni6264) for debugging/troubleshooting). Logs are manually deleted approximately once per month.
We **do not** collect private messages, Spotify song titles, osu! beatmap names, or other details that might appear in other fields of the user's status message.

---

## Why We Collect Data
We collect this data only to provide Activity Archivist's features, such as tracking user stats and enabling related bot commands.
Our lawful basis for processing is **legitimate interest**: the bot cannot function without storing activity data, since this is the whole point of this bot.

---

## How Long We Keep Data
- **Activity stats**: stored until the user deletes them via command.
- **Logs**: manually deleted approximately once per month.

---

## Sharing of Data
- Data is never sold or shared with third parties.
- Other users may see your stats, but you can disable this using the bot's privacy commands.

---

## Security
All data is stored locally on a private system, secured behind firewalls with no external ports open. Access is restricted to the developer.

---

## Your Rights
You have the right to:
- **Access** your data (via bot commands or by contacting us).
- **Export** your data (stats command or manual JSON export upon request).
- **Delete** your data at any time.
- **Block** others from viewing your data.
- The activity data stored by Activity Archivist is collected directly from Discord and cannot be manually altered. If you believe your data is inaccurate, you may request deletion instead.

## Contact
If you have privacy concerns or requests, contact the developer at:
- Discord: `@barni6264`
